# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Sales Analysis (Python + Colab)

I found this cool dataset with thousands of e-commerce sales records...  
So I thought â€” why not turn it into a mini project?

This analysis shows sales trends, top-performing countries, and how well orders are being fulfilled.  
I used **Python in Google Colab** â€” no fancy tools, just pure code and charts.

# What I Did

- Loaded and explored the dataset (`sales_data_sample.csv`)
- Cleaned it a bit (dates, nulls, etc.)
- Analyzed:
  - Monthly sales trends ðŸ“ˆ
  - Which country made the most money 
  - Order status (shipped, cancelled, etc.)
- Made 3 charts using Matplotlib

# Run it yourself (Colab)

You can open the notebook in Colab and run all cells:  
ðŸ‘‰ `sales_data.ipynb`

Make sure you upload the `sales_data_sample.csv` file in the same session.

# What I Found

- USA alone made â‚¹3.6M+
- Most sales happened in **November**
- 92.6% of orders were successfully shipped
